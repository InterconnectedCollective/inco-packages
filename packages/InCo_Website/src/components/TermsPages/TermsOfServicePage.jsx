            <h2>Username Policy</h2>
            <p>
                A username is the unique name used to identify oneself on InCo’s Leaderboard. We have a few rules on what can and can't be included in usernames. Please see our full policy guidelines below for all the details, including examples of the types of usernames that are and are not allowed.
            </p>
            <p>
                When registering for an account, choose a username. Usernames cannot contain offensive language, third-party trademarks, email or web addresses, or the words "InCo" or “LWT”.
            </p>
            <h3>What can usernames include?</h3>
            <p>
                Usernames can include letters, numbers, and some symbols. Usernames must be between 5 and 20 characters, and cannot include spaces.

            <h3>How do I report an inappropriate username?</h3>
            <p>
                To report inappropriate usernames, email <a href="mailto:intercoll.team@gmail.com">intercoll.team@gmail.com</a> - make sure your email includes “Inappropriate Username” in the subject and provide the inappropriate username in the email body. InCo has a number of systems in place to identify usernames that violate our policies, and we appreciate community safety. If we detect a name that violates our policies, we'll take steps to address and prevent it.
            </p>
            <h3>Full Policy</h3>
            <p>
                Each username must be unique. Duplicate usernames are not allowed. Usernames must be between 5 and 20 characters long.
